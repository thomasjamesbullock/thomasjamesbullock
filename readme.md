<b>About Me</b><br>
I am an experienced production and technical manager with a demonstrated history of success in manufacturing.

My demeanor is often described by others as high-energy, detail oriented, self-motivated, and forward thinking.

I’ve managed up to 300 employees at a time with successful leadership assignments across multiple manufacturing facilities (production supervisor, quality superintendent, production superintendent x4, and plant manager).

I’ve formally studied mathematics, computer science, business, statistics, and data science across 5 universities over the last 20 years.

I’m fluent in SQL, Python, and Excel.

I regularly use:
- MS SQL, SQL Lite, Pickle, Parquet, CSV
- Git and Azure DevOps
- Juypter Notebooks, Google Colab, Visual Studio, MS SMS
- Pandas, Numpy, Matlab, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodel, Skilearn, PyTorch
- Hypothesis Testing (various forms)
- Principal Component Analysis
- Regressions (OLS, Lasso, Ridge)
- Decision Trees (XGBoost, Random Forest)
- Neural Networks (deep, CNN, RNN)
- Allen-Bradley PLC (Studio 5000)
- Power BI (dashboarding, pipelines)

My career vision is to bridge the gap between management, production, IT, and accounting by solving big problems with automation and data science and then teaching the methodology to everyone who will listen.
